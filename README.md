# Quant-Finance
Python script to analyze historical stock data for a NIFTY50 stock from Yahoo Finance for the period from August 1, 2023, to July 29th, 2025. 

TO DOs : 
Install the necessary libraries (numpy, pandas, yfinance, matplotlib). 
Download the data for the given period. Extract the Open, High, Low, Close, and Volume columns. 
Calculate and plot the 14-day and 50-day relative strength index (RSI) on the same graph, with different colors for each RSI. 
Compute and visualize the daily percentage change in the Closing Prices and plot it as a histogram with appropriate bins. 
Create a subplot with three charts: The first chart should display the daily Closing Prices with 14-day and 50-day RSI. 
The second chart should show the daily Volume. The third chart should display the histogram of daily percentage changes.
